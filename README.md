# Formula1-Race-Predictor
Machine Learning Project to Predict Formula One Grand Prix race outcomes

# F1 Race Predictor
An ML project by Syed Wasif Dawood

# Planning Phase
## Defining the problem 
* Scope of Interest
 * Live Race Predictions? or Pre-Race Predictions --tentative choice = Pre-Race Predictions however Live Race Predictions would be cool, will discuss with Andrew
  * There are several factors that contribute to race outcomes, which factors have the highest impact on race outcomes? (This is a problem in itself..)
    * Possible key factors:
      * Qualifying Results: Grid position, Gaps in results
      * Car Preformance: Top Speed, Top Speed around corners
      * Driver Preformance: Points in the WDC etc
      * Team Strategy: Pit-Stop Strat(number, timing), Tire choices, Driver Prio
      * Weather Conditions: Track Temp, Rain, Wind
      * Penalties: Grid penalties, Safety car deployed? or red flags
      * Historical Trends: Past 5 race performances in the same track
